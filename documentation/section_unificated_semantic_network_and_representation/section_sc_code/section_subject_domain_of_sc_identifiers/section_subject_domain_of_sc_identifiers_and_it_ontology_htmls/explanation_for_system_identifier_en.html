<b><sc_element sys_idtf = "nrel_system_identifier">system sc-identifier</sc_element></b> is an identifier which is unique within the knowledge base. This ID is usually used in the source tree of the knowledge base of the lower level. To ensure the internationalisation it is recommended noting the global identifiers in English.
</p>
<p>
Symbols which used in the global identifier, is Latin letters, digits, the underscore and hyphen. 
</p>
<p>
Thus, it is most expedient to form the system sc-ID of sc-element from the main English-language by replacing all characters that are not included in the above-alphabet to symbol "_".
</p>
<p>
For example:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Main English ID: Partition. SCs-code. Selected</li>
<li> System identifier: Partition_SCs-code_Dividers<li>
</ol>
<p>
For naming sc-elements, which are the signs of role relations,the prefix "rrel" is used instead of the symbol "'" in the identifier and then the name of role relationships  is written after the underscore. 
</p>
<p>
For naming sc-elements, which are the signs of nonrole relations, the prefix "nrel" is used instead of the symbol "*" in the identifier and then the name of nonrole relationships  is written after the underscore.
</p>
<p>
For naming sc-elements, which are the signs of classes of concepts the prefix  "concept" is used in the identifier and then the name of the class is written after the underscore.
</p>
<p>
For naming sc-elements, which are the signs of the structures the prefix "struct" is used in the identifier and then the name of the structure is written after the underscore. 
</p>
<p>
For naming sc-elements, which are the signs of tuples the prefix "tuple" is used in the identifier and then the name of a tuple is written after the underscore.
