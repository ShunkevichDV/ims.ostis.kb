</p>
<p>
&lt;* non-atomic ID of connector*> ::= ( &lt;* the name of sc-element *&gt; &lt;* image of connector *&gt; &lt;* the name of sc-element *&gt; [*suffix *]
</p>
<p>

If there are multiple connectors between some sc-elements,suffixes are introduced to avoid ambiguity, for example (v1 -&gt; v2)1, (v1 -&gt; v2)2.
