<p>
Among sc-elements there is a need for singling out the signs of relations between objects. Allocate role relationships (or attributes) and norole relations. The dash (â€˜) is placed to identify the role of relationships in the end of the element's name. The asterisk (*) is placed to identify nerole relations at the end of the element's name.
