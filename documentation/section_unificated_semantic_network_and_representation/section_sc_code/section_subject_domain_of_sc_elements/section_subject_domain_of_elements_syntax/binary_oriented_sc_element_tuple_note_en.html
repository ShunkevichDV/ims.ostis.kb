Each sc-arc of general type is a designation oriented binary bundles of sc-elements, but the reverse is not true. Some binary oriented bundles of sc-elements can be identified more informative sc-elements:
<ul>
<li>sc-arcs of main type (if indicated binary oriented bundle is a concrete, real and fixed a bunch owned for relation of stationary supplies of sc-elements)</li>
</ul>

Some binary oriented  bundles of  sc-elements can be identified less informative (than the sc-arc of the general form) sc-elements:

<ul>
<li>sc-ribs (in the case it is priori unknown that denote a binary bundle is oriented);</li>
<li>sc-nodes (if it is priori unknown that the referent object is a binary oriented link)</li>
</ul>
